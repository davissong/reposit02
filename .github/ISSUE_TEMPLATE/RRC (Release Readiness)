Release Readiness Checklist Template
use this when getting ready to determine when ready to release
Build Release Number: RRC – Release Package Name and Version: VDD Link (link to product releases): Description: User Stories (US) created and approved: long list, copy and paste maybe?

US tests created: this may be shown other ways, using the sort/filter options on build number and the issue of type test and a screenshot? Almost back to the old traceabilty matrix excel. We want to avoid that...

US tests traced to release US: same as above in tool

All non-production testing completed (functional, regression, integration, SQA, UAT, etc.): again, may be a better way than trying to list this in an issue. But, this could be a sort on all issues of type test

No open critical or high severity defects being implemented into production: sort all issues of type ‘Bug’ by severity and grab that as a screen shot and drag and drop that screenshot right into the issue showing the result, hopefully 0 level 1 or 2 bugs…
